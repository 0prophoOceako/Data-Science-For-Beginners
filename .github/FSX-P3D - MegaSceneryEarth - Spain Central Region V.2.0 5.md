## Installation and requirements
 
To use FSX-P3D - MegaSceneryEarth - Spain Central Region v.2.0 5, you need to have either Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) or Lockheed Martin Prepar3D (P3D) installed on your computer.

You can download the add-on from SoundCloud[^2^], where you will find a link to a torrent file that contains all the necessary files. You will need a torrent client such as uTorrent or BitTorrent to download the files.
 
Once you have downloaded the files, you need to extract them using a program such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder named "MegaSceneryEarth" that contains several subfolders named after the provinces of Spain. You need to copy these subfolders into your FSX or P3D main folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X or C:\Program Files (x86)\Lockheed Martin\Prepar3D v4 (depending on your version). You also need to copy the file named "MegaSceneryEarth\_Spain\_Central\_Region.xml" into your FSX or P3D scenery library folder, which is usually located at C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\FSX\Scenery or C:\ProgramData\Lockheed Martin\Prepar3D v4\Scenery.
 
After copying the files, you need to activate the add-on in your FSX or P3D settings. To do this, launch your flight simulator and go to Settings > Scenery Library. You should see a new entry named "MegaSceneryEarth\_Spain\_Central\_Region" at the bottom of the list. Click on it and then click on "OK". The add-on is now ready to use.
