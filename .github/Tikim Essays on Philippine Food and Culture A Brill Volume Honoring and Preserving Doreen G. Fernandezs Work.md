Some of the topics that Fernandez covers in her essays include: the origins and evolution of Filipino cooking; the influences of Malay, Chinese, Spanish, American, and other cuisines on Filipino food; the role of rice, vinegar, coconut, fish sauce, and other ingredients in Filipino dishes; the significance of rituals, festivals, and celebrations in Filipino food culture; the diversity and regional variations of Filipino food; the challenges and opportunities for Filipino food in the global market; and the personal memories and anecdotes of Fernandez related to food.
 
Tikim is not only a book about food, but also a book about culture. It is a book that celebrates the richness and complexity of Filipino identity and heritage. It is a book that invites us to taste, savor, and appreciate the flavors and stories of Philippine food. It is a book that makes us hungry for more.
  
One of the reasons why Tikim is such a compelling and authoritative book is because of the author's background and expertise. Doreen Fernandez was born on October 28, 1934, in Manila, Philippines. She came from a family of educators, writers, and artists. She graduated from St. Scholastica's College with a degree in English Literature, and later earned her Ph.D. in Literature from Ateneo de Manila University. She taught at various institutions, including St. Scholastica's College, Maryknoll College, University of the Philippines Diliman, and Ateneo de Manila University, where she became a professor emeritus and chair of the Department of Communication.
 
Fernandez was also a prolific writer and columnist, who wrote for various publications, such as The Manila Chronicle, The Philippine Daily Inquirer, Food Magazine, Mr. & Ms., and Philippine Studies. She authored and edited several books on Philippine theatre and culture, such as Palabas: Essays on Philippine Theater History (1996), In Performance (1981), The Iloilo Zarzuela: 1903-1930 (1978), and A History of Theater in the Philippines (2006). She also wrote extensively about Filipino food and cuisine, such as Sarap: Essays on Philippine Food (1988), Kinilaw: A Philippine Cuisine of Freshness (1991), Fruits of the Philippines (1997), and of course, Tikim: Essays on Philippine Food and Culture (1994).
 
Fernandez was widely recognized and respected for her contributions to Philippine culture and scholarship. She received numerous awards and honors, such as the Cultural Center of the Philippines Gawad Para sa Sining for Literature (1990), the National Book Award for Essay (1992), the Gawad CCP Para sa Sining for Cultural Research (1999), the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Journalism, Literature, and Creative Communication Arts (2002), and the Order of National Artist for Literature (posthumous, 2018). She also served as a board member and consultant for various cultural organizations, such as the Cultural Center of the Philippines, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation, and the Filipinas Heritage Library.
 
Fernandez passed away on June 24, 2002, at the age of 67. She left behind a legacy of excellence, passion, and generosity that continues to inspire and influence many people today. As chef and educator Aileen Suzara writes in her foreword to Tikim: "Doreen Fernandez was a teacher who taught us how to see with new eyes; a storyteller who wove together narratives of place, people, history; a visionary who imagined new possibilities for Filipino foodways; a mentor who encouraged us to pursue our own paths; and a friend who shared her table with us."
