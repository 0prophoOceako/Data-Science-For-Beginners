Mendebilul is the longest and most complex story in the collection, spanning over 100 pages. It follows the narrator, a writer who attends a literary circle with his friends, as he recounts a vivid dream he had about his childhood. In his dream, he relives his experiences with a group of misfits who called themselves the Mendebils, led by a charismatic boy named Dan. The Mendebils were obsessed with a mysterious game that involved creating and destroying worlds with their minds. The narrator also remembers his love for a girl named Coca, who was Dan's sister and the only female Mendebil.
 
The story is full of symbolism, references, and intertextuality, drawing from various sources such as literature, mythology, philosophy, psychology, and science. Cartarescu creates a rich and intricate world that blurs the boundaries between reality and fiction, past and present, self and other. Mendebilul is a testament to the power of imagination and the role of art in shaping one's identity.

Mendebilul is not only a story about childhood, but also a story about writing and reading. The narrator is a self-conscious writer who addresses his audience directly and reflects on his own creative process. He also reveals his influences and inspirations, such as Pushkin, Eminescu, Borges, Kafka, and others. He plays with the conventions of storytelling, mixing genres, styles, and perspectives. He also challenges the reader's expectations and interpretations, creating ambiguity and paradox.
 
The story can be seen as a complex allegory of the human condition and the role of art in transcending it. The Mendebils are a metaphor for the artists who create and destroy worlds with their imagination. They are also a symbol of the oppressed and marginalized people who suffer under the totalitarian regime of communism. The game they play is a way of escaping and resisting the reality that surrounds them. The game is also a representation of the cosmic order and chaos, the dialectic between creation and destruction, life and death.
 
Mendebilul is a masterpiece of Romanian literature that showcases Cartarescu's talent and originality. It is a story that invites multiple readings and interpretations, offering a rich and rewarding experience for the reader. It is also a story that resonates with the universal themes of identity, memory, love, and art.
